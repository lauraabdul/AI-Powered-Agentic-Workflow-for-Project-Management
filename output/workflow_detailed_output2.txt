 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To improve your answer, you need to ensure that each user story is distinct and focused on a specific user's needs and desired outcome. Here are the instructions to fix the answer based on the feedback:

1. **Separate User Stories**: Divide the combined user story into separate, distinct user stories. Each user story should focus on a specific user persona, their action/feature, and the benefit/value they derive from it.

2. **Identify Specific User Needs**: Clearly define the needs and desired outcomes of each user persona in the user story. This will help in creating a more targeted and effective user story.

3. **Maintain Clarity and Focus**: Ensure that each user story is clear, concise, and focused on addressing the needs of a particular user persona. Avoid combining multiple user stories into one response.

4. **Review and Refine**: After separating the user stories, review them to ensure they meet the criteria of being distinct and focused. Make any necessary refinements to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of each user story.

By following these instructions, you will be able to create user stories that are distinct, focused, and aligned with the criteria for effective user story writing.

 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
To break down user stories into specific tasks, you need to identify the individual components or actions required to implement each user story. This involves analyzing the user story to understand the specific functionality or feature it describes, and then breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks that can be assigned to developers for implementation. Each task should represent a specific action or piece of work that contributes to the overall completion of the user story. By breaking down user stories into specific tasks, you can create a clear roadmap for development and ensure that all necessary work is accounted for and completed efficiently.

 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No. The answer provided does not meet the criteria of user stories following the exact structure: As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]. The response includes various user perspectives and their desires but lacks the specific structure required for user stories.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To improve the answer and ensure it follows the correct structure of user stories (As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]), follow these instructions:

1. Start by clearly identifying the different types of users who will interact with the product or service. For each user type, define their specific needs, goals, and motivations.

2. For each user type identified, craft a user story following the structure: "As a [type of user], I want [an action or feature] so that [benefit/value]." Ensure that each user story is focused on a specific user type and their unique requirements.

3. Clearly articulate the action or feature that the user wants and the corresponding benefit or value they expect to derive from it. This will help in aligning the user stories with the needs and expectations of the users.

4. Avoid mixing different user perspectives within a single user story. Each user story should be specific to a particular user type to maintain clarity and focus.

5. Review the user stories to ensure that they are concise, specific, and directly address the needs and goals of the identified user types. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure that each user story follows the prescribed structure.

By following these instructions, you can improve the answer by structuring the user stories correctly and ensuring that they align with the criteria of user stories.
